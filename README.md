# EK80_REST_Client
Python based client for the Simrad EK80 Echosounder

Release 21.15 of the EK80 scientific echosounder application introduced a new REST-ful API for application control and data subscription. The API is described using the swagger/OpenAPI spec allowing clients to be autogenerated using swagger-codegen. This project aims to wrap the "data" and "parameter" thin clients into a single, er, thicker, client for general purpose command and control of EK80 systems using Python.
